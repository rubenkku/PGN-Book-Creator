Book making utilities
       PolyGlot supports the "PolyGlot opening book format". This is the
       defacto standard non-proprietary opening book format.

       Roughly speaking a PolyGlot opening book is a collection of triples
       (position, move, weight). A "position" is represented by a 64-bit
       Zobrist hash key. The weight is proportional to the probability the
       move should be played.

       Other opening book formats such as ChessBase's .ctg format and Arena's
       .abk format are undocumented and proprietary. They can only be used by
       their own GUIs.

       PolyGlot can compile a pgn file into a binary PolyGlot book and
       furthermore it can merge two such binary books into a third one.

polyglot make-book
       PolyGlot supports the following options

       -pgn (default: "book.pgn")
           Input file in pgn format.

       -bin (default: "book.bin")
           Output file in PolyGlot format.

       -max-ply (default: 1024)
           Specifies the maximum ply-depth of lines included in the book.

       -min-game (default: 3)
           Specifies the minimum number of games that have to contain this
           move for it to be included in the book.

       -min-score (default: 0.0)
           Specifies the minimum score (or weight) this move should have
           received for it to  be included in the book. The score is
           2*(wins)+(draws), globally scaled to fit into 16 bits.

       -only-white
           Include only moves for white in the book.

       -only-black
           Include only moves for black in the book.

       -uniform
           Set all weights to 1. In other words, all moves will be selected
           with equal probability.

       
   polyglot merge-book
       PolyGlot supports the following options

       -in1
           First input file (in PolyGlot book format).

       -in2
           Second input file (in PolyGlot book format).

       -out (default: out.bin)
           Output file (in PolyGlot book format).

       Input files are not symmetrical, "in1" has priority over "in2". In
       other words when a position occurs both in "in1" and "in2" only the
       moves and weights from "in1" will be retained in "out".
